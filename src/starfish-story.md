### The Starfish Story

An old man walks along a beach he lives nearby.

... the previous night, a storm came through. 

And all along the beach,  glittering in the morning sun, are starfish. 

... drying out. 

dying

too far to be rescued by the tide ...

thousands,

dying

The old man stops, covers his horror with bemusement.

continues his walk 

but careful to step over, not onto the starfish.

about an hour of careful walking, in the distance, he can make out a figure, ... 

a youngin'

... throwing stuff into the ocean

litter?

No. Starfish.

... thoughtfully and carefully, throwing starfish into the ocean.

throwing

He's much closer now, shouting distance

The old man, looks at the youngin' -- mostly irritated.

He's within touching distance, too close, starfish distance.

Old man: "Why?"  
Old man: "You can't possibly save them all"  
Old man: "it doesn't matter"  

Splash

The youngin' excitedly replies:

"... It mattered to that one!"
