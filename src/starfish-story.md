### The Starfish Story

Living nearby,

an old man walks along a beach. 

glittering in the morning sun, are starfish. 

... drying out. 

dying

too far to be rescued by the tide ...

thousands

dying

Old man: "I guess they got stuck from the storm last night."

Covering horror with amusement.

continues his walk 

but careful to step over, not onto the starfish.

about an hour of careful walking, in the distance, he can make out a figure, ... 

a youngin'

... throwing stuff into the ocean

litter?

*Starfish.*

... slowly and carefully, throwing starfish into the ocean.

reach-and-throw, reach-and-throw, reach-and-throw

He's much closer now, shouting distance

Old Man is irritated.  
Old Man has Seen Things.  
Old Man knows this is pointless.  

He's within touching distance, starfish distance.

Old man: "Why?"  
Old man: "You can't possibly save them all"  
Old man: "it doesn't matter"  

Splash

The youngin' excitedly replies:

"... It mattered to that one!"
