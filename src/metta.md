Metta is a cultivated Buddhist religious emotion.

The following text is remixed from [The Path of Discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%E1%B9%ADisambhid%C4%81magga) or *Pts*

# Eight Aspects of Metta

* Non-oppression vs oppression
* Non-injury vs Injury
* Non-disappointment vs disappointment
* Non-deprivation vs deprivation
* Non-harrassment vs harrassment
* Freedom from enmity, not inimical
* Pleasure not pain
