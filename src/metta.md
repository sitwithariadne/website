**cw:** child abuse, neglect

We know what someone is like when they are angry, or sad. Metta is a mental state, a set of views, a practice, and a set of resultant emotions. 

Metta is one of four *sublimes*, or immeasurables. Metta as a practice object can hurt.  If it hurts to practice with this object, it's OK to do something else. You aren't a failure of a human being, [Metta can be a difficult object.](meditation-is-not-a-zero-risk-activity.md)

## How do I view Metta?
Metta is good vibes. Metta is kindness centered around harmlessness.


# Materials
There are a lot of books here about Trauma. My understanding is trauma is between us and Metta. Most of these books are intended to help reduce barriers for feeling metta *towards ourselves*
