# My practice of Metta

I come from a trauma background, so my default intentions without training are: inward self-hate, or outward misanthropy.

When I started practicing Metta, I was told to imagine the usual set: babies, cats, dogs, plants, fictional characters -- and send them love, warmth, good vibes. 

I haven't felt enough love over the course of this lifetime to have a target to recall ... let alone send anyone it. Several times I was suicidal afterwards. I couldn't feel love, but I certainly felt despair.

My hope is to share my understanding of Metta via *Path of Discrimination* and how it shows a lower spoon cost to practice Metta.

* Metta is on a spectrum, between easier intentions (intending beings to be free from cruelty) towards harder ones (intending beings towards bliss)

A good shortcut to understand Metta ...

**Metta is the opposite of cruelty.**

Metta comes in two main variations, a wish for beings to be free from something, and a wish for beings to have something.

Metta is the antidote to ill-will. From the *Pts* ...

# Eight Aspects of Metta

* Non-oppression vs oppression
* Non-injury vs Injury
* Non-disappointment vs disappointment
* Non-deprivation vs deprivation
* Non-harrassment vs harrassment
* Freedom from enmity, not inimical
* Pleasure not pain
* Bliss not pain

**Example 1 - Others away from home**

1. I am not at home
1. My mind has been trained into misanthoropy
1. I feel pained, empty, agitated, dissatisfied, conceited, (it's a long list)
1. I see a stranger.
1. A thought: "I hate this person"
1. I recall, "ill-will hurts a lot, can I do something about it?"
1. I recall the *Pts* instructions (what's on this page about specific intentions and targets)
1. I substitute Metta for Ill-will: "Well, I don't want them to be **oppressed**"
1. I feel some relief

**Example 2 - Towards myself, at home**

1. I am at home.
1. My mind has been trained into misanthoropy
1. I feel pained, empty, agitated, dissatisfied, conceited, (it's a long list)
1. I see family.
1. A thought: "I hate this person"
1. I recall, "ill-will hurts a lot, can I do something about it?"
1. I recall the *Pts* instructions (what's on this page about specific intentions and targets)
1. I substitute Metta for Ill-will: "Well, I don't want to build enmity, I don't want us to both hate each other"
1. I feel some relief

There are a lot of words here I don't really understand, so I looked them up in the [OED.](https://www.oed.com/)
