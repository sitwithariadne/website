**cw:**  self-harm

**Metta meditation**  is usually a wish for goodwill or kindness.

**Karuna meditation** is usually a wish for beings to be free from suffering.

_Lines from my diary_

    May I be free from suffering.
    
    May I be free from pain.
    
    May I see and be free of self-hate.
    
    May I be free from self-criticism.
    
    May my self-compassion be unconditional.
    
    May I see and reduce the harm I cause to myself & others.
    
    May I be free of suicidal intent.
    
    May I see and be free of shame.
    
    May I be free from fear & danger.

  
(How the above is supposed to work is, you pick a line or two or three, and you just repeat them, holding the intention sincerely. If you can, feel and cultivate what that intention feels like, and feel and cultivate felt emotional responses.  **Be as gentle as possible.**)
