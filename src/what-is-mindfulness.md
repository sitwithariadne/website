I'm reading  [Dissociation, Mindfulness, and Creative Meditations.](https://www.amazon.com/Dissociation-Mindfulness-Creative-Meditations-Christine/dp/1138838314)  
  
This part is verbatim (page 2):  

> _Mindfulness is an altered state of awareness and consciousness. It is a "thing," it is a different way of being and it is as different as being awake than being asleep. The brain is different in a mindful state than ordinary consciousness; it is not just an act of the mind. [...] Mindfulness is a grander brain task and is based on the maturity of the brain, not just an act of the mind._
 
I have reworded and remixed what follows as Mindfulness Targets.
