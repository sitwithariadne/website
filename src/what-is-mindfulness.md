# A Request to the reader

I request the reader to consider this page slowly and carefully.

I had to track down and find a clinical resource, because for much of my practice ... I wasn't meditating, I was dissociating.

# What is Mindfulness

From [Dissociation, Mindfulness, and Creative Meditations](https://www.routledge.com/Dissociation-Mindfulness-and-Creative-Meditations-Trauma-Informed-Practices-to-Facilitate-Growth/Forner/p/book/9781138838314)
  
This part is verbatim (page 2):  

> Mindfulness is an altered state of awareness and consciousness. It is a "thing," it is a different way of being and it is as different as being awake than being asleep. The brain is different in a mindful state than ordinary consciousness; it is not just an act of the mind. [...] Mindfulness is a grander brain task and is based on the maturity of the brain, not just an act of the mind.
 
I have reworded and remixed what follows as Mindfulness Targets.  

#### Emotions that are felt (usually very)

* Self Connection
* Grounded
* Calm
* Insightful
* Blissful
* Wholeness
* Self-Compassion & compassion for others

#### The body feels like it is

* Weighted
* Solid
* Comfortable
* Home

#### Intuitive Knowledge of

* Feelings and what they are for
* Feelings as aspects and an extension of being (there is anger not "I am angry")

#### A sense of being

* Loved and loving
* Safe and in control of ourselves and the environment
* Balanced, stable and regulated
* Full bodied, and embodied
* Generous to ourselves and others

#### A sense of being connected to
