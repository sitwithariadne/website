This part is verbatim (page 2):  

> Mindfulness is an altered state of awareness and consciousness. It is a "thing," it is a different way of being and it is as different as being awake than being asleep. The brain is different in a mindful state than ordinary consciousness; it is not just an act of the mind. [...] Mindfulness is a grander brain task and is based on the maturity of the brain, not just an act of the mind.
