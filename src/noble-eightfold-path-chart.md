Some modifications I've made listening to Ajahn Brahm a while.

**Sati**, a Pali word, the most common English translation is "mindfulness" but closer would be "Kindfulness". We aren't meant to look onto our own situations with neutrality, but with a sense of compassion or gentleness. That extra touch allows greater stability observing the harder and darker emotions.

**Samadhi**, a Pali word, the most common English translation is "concentration" which Westerners take to mean "do this with immense effort". The closer translation would be stillness, i.e. the mind doesn't need to move, because it's perfectly content doing what it's doing.

**Saá¹…kappa**, a Pali word, the most common English translation may be "thought" or "resolve". Closer would be "motivation" ... the reason we do the practice, the goals being aspired towards.
