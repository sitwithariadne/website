1. Assume it's possible to live with less misery/despair/suffering/torment/anguish/pain/regret (`suffering`). It is `self-compassion` to desire less `suffering`.
 
2.  Using `self-compassion`, begin to look inward and see that your current mental-system/emotional-intelligence/mindfulness/consciousness/awareness/presence/skillset (`the-mind`)  isn't sufficient to currently reduce `suffering` to a place you'd like. Realize it's possible some of your `suffering` might be caused by maladaptive stuff in `the-mind`.

3.  Figure out what a conceptual model of a preferred emotional system would be. "I'd like to suffer the least amount possible while being alive while in general having as much happiness and joy as possible" (`serenity`) as a working example. -- Direct the `self-compassion` towards getting `serenity`.

4.  Looking for the exit to `suffering`, gain new skills and experiences with art/meditation/yoga/exercise/dance/improv/therapy/prayer/religion/psychedelics/mysticism/a-vocation/purpose^[Things that lead towards pleasant emotions with the least amount of harm ] (`interior skills`). 

6.  Use these `interior skills` with `the-mind` to see how the balance between `serenity`/`suffering` works. 
	- Notice you sometimes have `serenity` when doing `interior skills`.
	- Notice when not doing the `interior skills` there tends to be more `suffering`.

7. Notice how `the-mind` can fall into `suffering`. Practice getting it back into `serenity`. Discover that the process is very cause-and-effect (`dependencies`).

8. Train `the-mind` to default to  `serenity`. Practice attaining and staying in `serenity`.
