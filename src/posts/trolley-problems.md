The *trolley problem* is a surreal violent thought experiment, that invites participants to commit [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence) themselves.

From Wikipedia:

> Imagine the following:
> 
> An unstoppable trolley is moving along a set of railroad tracks.
>
> Ahead, there is a switch leading to two pairs of tracks. Past the switch are two tracks:
>
> **Tracks 1:** This is the default route if no action is taken. Five people are tied to the tracks and cannot move. If the trolley takes this route these five people will surely die.
> 
> **Track 2:** The trolley takes this route if and only if the switch is activated. One person is tied to the tracks. If the trolley takes this route this person will surely die.

Usually this problem is given with some stipulations:

1. The participant is told they __must__ make a choice.
2. Someone __must__ die.

My questions are ...

*How much violence is used on the participant to force them to solve it?*

*How much is appropriate?*

# You must do something

Why do we feel compelled to engage?

"I don't do anything"

"Well, if you do nothing those five people die and it would have been your fault."

Notice the gaslighting and the guilt-trip. Notice the questioner is using violence to gain compliance.

Who made the thought problem? Who invited others to it? Who is trying to make it someone else's problem?

"You are now involved." In the abuse literature this would be forced teaming. Forced teaming is along the lines of "Now that we are in this, together, you might as well participate."

Forced teaming is another compliance tool.

I'd invite the reader to go "Oh, sorry. I don't engage with violent thought problems."

# Notice the Surreal Nature of the Problem

So many stipulations to attempt to force compliance:

* It's imaginary so the violence is OK.
* It can't be stopped / it must happen
* These are the only two choices
* Someone dies
* "Everyone knows what the right choice is"

Real-life situations are rarely either-or. If a problem appears either-or, I'd invite you to do some more brainstorming to think of another solution.

If someone says "you must comply" know ... what they are really saying is "I hope you don't recognize you have a choice to say no, and walk away."

# Its used to teach moral reasoning

There are plenty of real world examples of people making good and bad moral choices without having to invite surreal ones, and without inviting others to "make their choice".

We can avoid a lot of suffering by choosing to not participate.
