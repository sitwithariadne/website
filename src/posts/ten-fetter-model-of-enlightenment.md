[Theravada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada)  is based on the oldest extant texts of Buddhism. Fetters are mental processes that lead towards suffering.

Fetters are in grey.

_Starting -_ **Stream-seeker**_, looking for deliverance/salvation/freedom from suffering._  

1.  `skeptical doubt`  (of path, the Buddha, the practice, the fruits, etc.)

2.  `rites and rituals`  (not understanding mechanics, why stuff works, engaging in practices that don't relieve suffering)

3. ` belief or consequences from self-view`  (basic duality, belief in independent self, belief in a soul, ignorance about basic impersonal causality)

_1st Path - **Sottapana** - Knows what the path is, on the path, using fruit of the path, understands all parts of identity are fair game. Has had a clean taste of arhatship, to show the path isn't just possible, but inevitable._

First three fetters are removed.

_2nd Path -  **Sakadagami** - Understands that craving and aversion drive a lot of unwholesome behaviors -- is working to remove them -- has a lot of them already removed._

First three fetters removed, ill-will and sense-desire are greatly reduced.

4.  `ill-will`  (aversion based on not understanding impersonal causality)

5.  `sense-desire`  (craving based on not understanding impersonal causality)

_3rd Path -  **Anagami** - Does not experience ill-will, hatred, greed, aversion, craving, or sense-desire. Lives in the sublimes, exits to understand self-ignorance._

First five fetters removed.

6.  `desire for material rebirth`  (craving to be someone else, material existence, usually rich)

7.  `desire for immaterial rebirth`  (craving to be someplace else, immaterial existence, usually heaven)

8.  `restlessness`  (the urge towards doing vs being, inability to accept what is vs what could be)

9.  `conceit`[^conceit] ("I am this. I am better. I am worse. I am the same.")

10.  `ignorance`  (any conditioned action from karma, any gap in full mental and bodily awareness)

_4th path -  **Arhatship** - All contents and processes of mind are known, centerless, free from suffering of any kind._

All ten fetters removed.
