# 1. Human life contains pain and suffering.

We are in the realm, and these things happen here.

- Sickness
- Old Age
- Death
- Poverty
- Relationship Separations
- Anguish
- Disappointment 
- Addiction
- Loss
- Unfairness
- Cruelty

Mental suffering, leads to suicide. It's the limit of what a person can endure.

# We want things life can never give us

- Breakups to never occur
- Ourselves and loved ones to always be healthy
- Death to not occur
- Cruelty to not exist

# How to use suffering

1. Carry it around with you. Notice others don't want to hang out with someone who's complaining all the time.
2. Learn from it. Learn from **all** of it. Demonstrate mastery over understanding how suffering works by being gentle, patient, and kind.

Feel your own pain, so completely, it builds empathy for others. You can say, "I know how that feels."
