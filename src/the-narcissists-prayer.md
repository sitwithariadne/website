# The Narcissist's Prayer

> _That didn't happen._<br>
> _And if it did, it wasn't that bad._<br>
> _And if it was, that's not a big deal._<br>
> _And if it is, that's not my fault._<br>
> _And if it was, I didn't mean it._<br>
> _And if I did, you deserved it._

## Purpose
This page explains the mechanics of the prayer which relies on `the dark tools`.

```
That didn't happen . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 - Negate  
And if it did, it wasn't that bad. . . . . 2 - Minimize  
And if it was, that's not a big deal . . . 3 - Project  
And if it is, that's not my fault. . . . . 4 - Normalize  
And if it was, I didn't mean it. . . . . . 5 - Redirect
And if I did, you deserved it. . . . . . . 6 - DARVO
```

#### A and B
I didn't want to use names people have, so I went with A and B. Please use whatever names you feel comfortable with.

For ease:<br>
A stands for **A**wkward<br>
B stands for **B**ad<br>

B steps on A's foot. I'm imaginging a scenario at a school, ages 15 to 18.

## 1. That Didn't Happen - Negate

Denying Reality.

> **A:**  You stepped on my foot.
> 
> **B:**  I didn't.

## 2. And if it did, It Wasn't That Bad - Minimize

Downplaying Harm.

> **A:**  No, you stepped on my foot.
> 
> **B:** It looks fine.

## 3. And if it was, That's Not a Big Deal - Project

Telling someone how to feel.

> **A:**  Um ... it does hurt, it hurts a lot.
> 
> **B:**  Calm down.

## 4. And if it is, that's not my fault - Normalize

Telling someone how to think.

> **A:**  B, this really hurts!
> 
> **B:**  Shit happens.

## 5. And if it was, I didn't mean it - Redirect

Moving the goalposts.

> **A:** It seems like it was an accident. Aren't you sorry?
> 
> **B:** I didn't intend to step on you. 

## 6. And if I did, you deserved it -  [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO)

Becoming the victim.

> **A:** What? You stepped on me, say you are sorry.
> 
> **B:** You're interrogating me after I already said I didn't mean it. Stop.
