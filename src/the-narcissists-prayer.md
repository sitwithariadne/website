_The Narcissist prayer works by gaslighting, or overwriting someone else's reality. Two people believe different things -- the Narcissist is very forceful about their version of events and when confronted becomes the victim._

> _That didn't happen._ 
> _And if it did, it wasn't that bad._  
> _And if it was, that's not a big deal._ 
> _And if it is, that's not my fault._
> _And if it was, I didn't mean it._  
> _And if I did, you deserved it._

It's worth committing to memory each line of the prayer to be aware of toxic micro-interactions.  

```
That didn't happen.                   (1 - Negate)  
And if it did, it wasn't that bad.    (2 - Minimize)  
And if it was, that's not a big deal. (3 - Project)  
And if it is, that's not my fault.    (4 - That's How The World is)  
And if it was, I didn't mean it.      (5 - Claim Pure Intentions)  
And if I did, you deserved it.        (6 - DARVO)
```

### Short Definition of Narcissism with Examples

**The Nature Example - Two People, Two Childhoods**

**cw:** child neglect, narcissism, NPD.

> **Quinn**  enjoys nature. Quinn spent a lot of time outside since early childhood. Quinn has easy access to the feelings nature gives them: peace, safety, comfort, connection. When Quinn was growing up, Quinn's parents validated Quinn's feelings often going on hiking and camping trips and repeatedly telling Quinn that Quinn's feelings were important. Quinn's parents weren't really into camping or hiking, themselves, but they made time for Quinn to pursue their interests. Quinn has felt these feelings, clearly, for years and has a lot of practice. When someone says nature is stupid ... Quinn's internal feelings don't change. Quinn understands, "This person hates nature, but that's OK, it doesn't change how I feel about it."
> 
> **Morgan**  hates nature. When asked why Morgan responds by mentioning a famous conservative YouTuber who hates the national parks system and promotes drilling in ANWR. Early in Morgan's life, going to school they talked to other kids who got to go to parks and decided they wanted to go. When Morgan asked their parents, their parents became angry telling Morgan to go play videogames. Morgan asked one more time, but this time Morgan's dad screamed at them to leave them alone. Morgan's brain, trying to optimize for staying in the family and not being exiled now buries the desire under a new emotion, shame. Years have passed. Since shame is a deeply painful experience, when Morgan was exposed to the famous YouTuber they latched on immediately, with a ready made excuse why enjoying nature isn't important or worth doing.

The core of narcissism is avoiding shame at all costs by trying to do what others value. Morgan is validated by the Famous YouTuber and is now part of a community which helps them avoid shame, by substituting it for anger. Human seek social validation ... some us, like Quinn, get it unconditionally and others, like Morgan, get it with conditions attached. The greater the conditions attached, the more distant from ourselves we become, until our internal world looks more like a mask to be put on than a person.

In this example Quinn and Morgan have the same starting conditions, but very different kinds of validation.

## (1) That Didn't Happen - Negate


> **Quinn:**  You stepped on my foot.
> 
> **Morgan:**  I didn't.
>
> Morgan learned early in life the easy way out is to invalidate people. Morgan was invalidated early and often, so now ... they are doing what they've learned to others. Lying to Morgan is a better outcome then feeling shame.
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):**  Maybe I imagined it?
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):**  Maybe they didn't notice.

## (2) And If It Did, It Wasn't That Bad - Minimize

> **Quinn:**  No, you did step on my foot.
> 
> **Morgan:** It looks fine.
>
> Morgan doesn't understand the problem. The foot looks fine. Morgan doesn't have a strong sense of Quinn's internal world, not really having one themselves. Minimizing what happened comes easily, and avoids shame.
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):** This hurts, but maybe it's not so bad?
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):** Morgan is pretty confident I'm OK, I'll be OK.


## (3) And If It was, That's Not a Big Deal - Project

 
> **Quinn:**  Um ... it does hurt, it hurts a lot.
> 
> **Morgan:**  It's not a big deal. Get over it.
>
> When Morgan was growing up, they heard this line used ... a lot. Something would happen and Morgan's parents would go "it's not a big deal." Morgan found out none of their thoughts or feelings were "a big deal".
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):** (Still in pain) I guess I'll be fine.

## (4) And if it is, that's not my fault - That's How The World is

> **Quinn:**  Morgan, this really hurts!
> 
> **Morgan:**  It happens, people's feet get stepped on all the time.
>
> At this point Quinn knows how this whole exchange is supposed to go. Morgan is supposed to validate Quinn's intangible reality, harm has happened. How Morgan sees it is ... this is how the world works. Morgan's parents have told them "this is how the world works, people are cruel." Morgan has experienced cruelty enough to think it's commonplace. Morgan has internalized it.
> 
> **Quinn (to themselves):** Why can't Morgan just say they are sorry?


## (5) And if it was, I didn't mean it - Claim Pure Intentions

> **Quinn:** It seems like it was an accident. Aren't you sorry?
> 
> **Morgan:** I didn't intend to step on you. 
>
> Morgan will avoid shame at all costs. One method is to think of what "good people do" which is they don't intend harm. Harm has happened and instead of apologizing for the harm, Morgan will recall the moment before the accident, where nothing was intended. Instead of acknowledging the moment Quinn cares about, the accident, Morgan will bring up the moment before, to point out their complete non-involvement, as if they were not present at all.
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):** .. But you still hurt me. Please acknowledge you hurt me. Please acknowledge you care.

## (6) And if I did, you deserved it -  [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO)

> **Quinn:** What? You stepped on me, say you are sorry.
> 
> **Morgan:** ... You were in my way. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? Stop attacking me! Calm down. 
>
> The end of the script. The last tool combines the set in one attack, where Morgan will claim they are the victim. From here it becomes a JADE loop (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain). Quinn should understand the apology will never come, because it involves emotions Morgan never wants to have.
>
> **Quinn (to themselves):** Maybe I'm not being clear enough ... Let me try again.
