The Buddha gave this advice in a Sutta called *Offensive.*

[AN 3.27 - Offensive](https://suttacentral.net/an3.27/en/sujato?)

**Looked on with Disgust and Avoided**
*  Unethical, bad qualities, filthy
*  Underhanded, not an ascetic or spiritual practitioner (claims to be one -- rotten and depraved)
    Following this person you can get a bad reputation

**Looked on with Equanimity and Avoided**
* Irritable and bad-tempered
* Light criticism results in them blowing up
* Displays annoyance, hatred, and bitterness
   There is a risk this person could harm you, physically or mentally

I originally read it in this book, on page 55.
