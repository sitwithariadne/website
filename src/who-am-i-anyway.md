**cw: pain, abuse, trauma, dissociation, suicide, self-harm**

I am familiar with [dissociation](https://www.isst-d.org/resources/dissociation-faqs/). While dissociaton can be a useful coping strategy, it is disruptive, so I started to look for alternative ways to cope.

Forgetting things isn't glamorous. There is always the risk that if I don't write something down, I will forget it. This blog represents some of the brightest parts of myself I want to remember and share with others.

Without written record, my lived experience sometimes becomes moment-to-moment and some moments are unbearable. I'm in several overlapping groups for suicide risk. I want to survive those future moments of pain. 

Some of the charts found on this blog, I have laminated in my house. They are my personal materials.

Other charts I have made to reference quickly for online peer-support.

In the spirit of giving this book isn't monetized. Most of the content contained is dedicated to the Public Domain via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) so it can be copied, remixed, and repurposed.

I hope nothing I've written in this book causes myself or others to come to harm.
