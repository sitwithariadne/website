[Theravada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada) is based on the oldest extant texts of Buddhism. Fetters are mental processes that lead towards suffering.

Fetters are numbered, one to ten. I've put my personal understandings of the fetters next to them in paranthesis.

# Start
 **Stream-seeker** - Looking for relief/deliverance/salvation/freedom from suffering.  

# 1st Path
**Sottapana** - Knows what the path is, on the path, using fruit of the path, understands all parts of identity are fair game. Has had a clean taste of arhatship, to show the path isn't just possible, but inevitable.

First three fetters are removed.

1.  `Skeptical Doubt` (of path, practice, Buddha, fruits, attainments, fetters, etc.)

2.  `Rites and Rituals` (not understanding mechanics, why stuff works, engaging in practices that don't relieve suffering)

3. ` Belief or Consequences from Self-View` (basic duality, belief in independent self, belief in a soul, ignorance about basic impersonal causality)

# 2nd Path
**Sakadagami** - Understands that craving and aversion drive a lot of unwholesome behaviors -- is working to remove them -- has a lot of them already removed.

Has weakened fetters four and five.

4.  `Ill-Will`  (aversion based on not understanding impersonal causality)

5.  `Sense-Desire`  (craving based on not understanding impersonal causality)

# 3rd Path
**Anagami** - Does not experience ill-will, hatred, greed, aversion, craving, or sense-desire. Lives in the sublimes, exits to understand self-ignorance.

First five fetters removed.

# 4th Path
**Arhatship** - All contents and processes of mind are known, and free from suffering of any kind.

Upper Five fetters are removed.

6.  `Desire for Material Rebirth`  (craving to be someone else, material existence, usually rich)

7.  `Desire for Immaterial Rebirth`  (craving to be someplace else, immaterial existence, usually heaven)

8.  `Restlessness`  (samsara motion: the urge towards doing vs being, inability to accept what is vs what could be)

9.  `Conceit` ("I am better.", "I am worse.", "I am the same.")

10.  `Ignorance`  (any conditioned action from karma, any gap in full mental and bodily awareness)
