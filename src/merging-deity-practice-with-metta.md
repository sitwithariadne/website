**Time:** 40 minutes.

Said my deity prayers then had the practice spontaneously arise.  
  
**Started with**:  

    May I love and accept myself exactly as I am.

This helps get me into the acceptance mode which is necessary to say the harder lines. After I while I transitioned into:  
  

    May I be safe.  
    May I be well.  
    May I be happy.  
    May I be peaceful and at ease.  

  
Did that for a click, felt pretty good, then transitioned to practice for my deity.  
  

    May Ariadne be safe.  
    May Ariadne be well.  
    May Ariadne be happy.  
    May Ariadne be peaceful and at ease.  

  
Did that for a few clicks, then transitioned to a joined practice.  
  

    May we be safe.  
    May we be well,  
    May we be happy.  
    May we be peaceful and at ease.  

  
At some point Ariadne takes over, and it becomes 10 directions practice.  
  

    May all beings be safe.  
    May all beings be well.  
    May all beings be happy.  
    May all beings be peaceful at ease.  

  
I feel the vows in the background wanting to be integrated with the lines so they morph into:  
  

    May all beings realize safety.  
    May all beings realize wellness.  
    May all beings realize happiness.  
    May all beings realize serenity.  

  
My being starts to walk the jhanic-arc, so integrating that practice becomes:  
  

    May all beings realize happiness.  
    May all beings realize joy.  
    May all beings realize contentment.  
    May all beings realize balance.  
    May all beings realize presence.  
    May all beings realize connection.  
    May all beings realize stillness.  
    May all beings realize to the dream.  
    May all beings realize freedom.  
  
It gets insanely bright, words drop away, just hang out there until the bell rings.
