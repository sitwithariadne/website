> My friend Holley Humphrey identified some common behaviors that
prevent us from being sufficiently present to connect empathically
 with others. The following are examples:
 > 
> 
>  **Advising:** “I think you should … ” “How come you didn’t … ?”   
>  
> **One-upping:** “That’s nothing; wait’ll you hear what happened to me.”   
>
> **Educating:** “This could turn into a very positive experience for you if you just … ”    
>
> **Consoling:** “It wasn’t your fault; you did the best you could.”   
>
>**Story-telling:** “That reminds me of the time … ”  
>
> **Shutting down:** “Cheer up. Don’t feel so bad.”
> 
>  **Sympathizing:** “Oh, you poor thing … ”    
>
>**Interrogating:** “When did this begin?”    
>
>**Explaining:** “I would have called but … ”
>
> **Correcting:** “That’s not how it happened.”
