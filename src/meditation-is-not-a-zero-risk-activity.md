Practicing, guiding, teaching, and/or suggesting meditation involves risk.

# First, Do No Harm
I think meditation is not intended to harm us.

A framework of **First, Do No Harm** will have clear boundaries around when to stop a session.

# Risks

### Big Risks
* suicide
* suicidal ideation
* self-harm

### Medium Risks
* Dissocation
* Flashbacks

### The Unavoidables
* changes in behavior (sometimes good, sometimes bad)

# Mechanics of Meditation and Trauma

Our brains have an organ called the medial prefrontal cortext (mPFC). It's basically the spot on our brows between our eyeballs. It's also the seat of mindfulness.

Developed mindfulness leads to an altered state of consiounsess as distict and different as being awake is to being asleep.

Our psyches know this ability is there ... trying to reach for it, and failing can be traumatic in-and-of-itself.

This altered state is meant to be learned under supervision from someone else with experience, a lot like how a child learns how to person with an adult present.

In our culture of self-reliance, mindfulness is seen as another activity, like watching TV, or going for a walk. It isn't.

> I __**strongly recommend**__ listening to guided meditations, for **years** if required. It's OK to need support in this area.

### Ariadne's Stopping Points
**Emotions associated with self-harm.**
* Hopelessness, helplessness, despair
* Dissociation
* Flashbacks
* Chest pain

Guiding our own practice, I recommend erring on the side of caution. Can a practice be made gentler?

Guiding others practices ... is there enough mindfulness and attentiveness to understand how others are doing? Can you tell if someone is dissociating? Do you know them well enough to sense a change in their behavior?

### In Ourselves
##### Emotions
* Positive? 
* Negative? 
* Helpful?
* Painful?

##### Pain
* Around the head? 
* Chest?

##### Thoughts
* Memories? 
* Flashbacks?
* Tasks? 
* Arguments?

## In Others
##### Posture
* Turned in? 
* Guarded? 
* Withdrawn?
* Excited?
* Animated?

##### Energy
* More? 
* Less?

##### Speech
* Nonverbal?
* Quiet? 
* Reserved?

##### Breathing
* Labored? 
* Missing? 
* Breath-holding?

##### Skin
* Flushed? 
* Pale? 
* Goose-bumps?

# These groups are at risk for harm
I've seen these groups struggle most. **It is by no means definitive.** 

### Self-loathing
Inability to meditate is frequently tied to moral agency, and seen as a personal failing.

__**Difficulty meditating is not a moral failing.**__


### Traumatized
Quiet introspection can lead to flashbacks.

### Dissociative
Difficult emotions, unfamiliar tasks, and pressures can lead to dissociation.

Especially insidious because it can look like meditation. People who dissociate tend to be very quiet (nonverbal). To communicate to someone non-verbal, ask if they would like to write down their thoughts and feelings.

### Low Dopamine - ADHD
Failure to sit still, and/or pay attention.

Religious texts group this under "restlessness." Western medicine knows it as a dopamine shortfall. Meditation is easier with movement, music, interesting sensory objects, medication, and/or caffeine.

# Metta is Especially Dangerous

This is a well-intentioned and bright practice. I'm familiar with it from Buddhism, where it has prerequisites for safety:
* Stable loving community
* Secure attachment
* Easy call up of the feelings of love and compassion.

Those without the above prerequisites are in danger.

## A Typical Metta failure:

1. Someone is told to direct their attention towards feelings of love and kindness.
1. They cannot.
1. As they continuously fail to arouse these feelings, **much darker feelings are aroused.**


### Categories of feelings they might feel instead (an incomplete list!):

##### Anger
* Self-hatred

##### Disgust
* Contempt

##### Fear
* Helpless
* Insecure
* Anxious 
* Vulnerable

##### Surprise
* Shock
* Overwhelm
* Confusion

##### Sadness
* Depressed
* Hopeless
* Miserable
* Fatigued
* Despair
* Heartbreak

##### Shame
* Self-conscious
* Embarassment
* Humiliation
* Awkward
* Chagrin

### Specific feelings that can lead to suicidal ideation
When two specific feelings combine, they lead directly to suicidal ideation

##### Fear
* Hopeless

##### Sadness
* Despair
