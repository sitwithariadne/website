Practicing, guiding, teaching, and/or suggesting meditation involves risk.

The big risks are: suicide, suicidal ideation, self-harm, flashbacks, dissociation, changes in behavior, changes in relationships, changes at work ... all kinds of human behavior. It is difficult to predict what a practice can uncover or reveal. 

Meditation can arouse difficult feelings, memories, and awareness. In our culture of self-reliance, the things brought to the surface can deeply hurt us, without the support of others. 

This is one of the reasons a teacher is frequently recommended: to identify when support is needed, and provide it.

# First, Do No Harm
I think meditation is best when it doesn't add to our existing pain.

 A framework of **First, Do No Harm** will have clear boundaries around when to stop a session.

### Ariadne's Stopping Points
* Emotions associated with self-harm.
	* Hopelessness, helplessness, despair[^1]
* Dissociation[^2]
* Flashbacks
* Chest pain

[^1]: When I have these emotions I'm in either distress or crisis. See the below charts.

[DBT Reality Acceptance](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2021/06/dbt-reality-acceptance-skills.html)

[^2]: It's hard to define dissociation, it's easier to define it as the opposite of mindfulness.

Guiding our own practice, I recommend erring on the side of caution. Can a practice be made gentler?

Guiding others practices ... is there enough mindfulness and attentiveness to understand how others are doing? Can you tell if someone is dissociating? Do you know them well enough to sense a change in their behavior?

### In Ourselves
* Emotions
	* Positive? Negative? Helpful? Hurtful?[^3]
* Pain
	* Around the head? Chest?
* Thoughts
	* Memories? Tasks? Arguments?

[^3]: It took some practice, but I stop at self-loathing, and self-criticism. I do something else, like go for a walk, do some art, sleep.

### In Others

* Posture
	* Turned in? Guarded? Withdrawn? Excited? Animated?
* Energy
	* More? Less?
* Speech
	* Nonverbal? Quiet? Reserved?
* Breathing
	* Labored? Missing? Breath-holding?
* Skin
	* Flushed? Pale? Goose-bumps?


# These groups are at risk for harm
I've seen these groups struggle most. **It is by no means definitive.** 

### Self-loathing[^4]
Inability to meditate is frequently tied to moral agency, and seen as a personal failing.

[^4]: Can lead to shame-anger-rage spirals.

### Traumatized
Quiet introspection can lead to flashbacks.

### Dissociative[^5]
Difficult emotions, unfamiliar tasks, and pressures can lead to dissociation.

[^5]: Especially insidious because it can look like meditation. People who dissociate tend to be very quiet (nonverbal). To communicate to someone dissociative, ask if people would like to write down their thoughts and feelings.

### Low Dopamine - ADHD[^6]
Failure to sit still, and/or pay attention.

[^6]: The texts call this restlessness. I call it a dopamine shortfall. Meditation is easier with movement, music, interesting sensory objects, medication, and/or caffeine.




# Metta is Especially Dangerous

This is a well-intentioned and bright practice. I'm familiar with it from Buddhism, where it has prerequisites for safety:
* Stable loving community
* Secure attachment
* Easy call up of the feelings of love and compassion.

Those without the above prerequisites are in danger.



## A Typical Metta failure:[^7]

1. Someone is told to direct their attention towards feelings of love and kindness.
2. They cannot.
3. As they continuously fail to arouse these feelings, **much darker feelings are aroused.**

[^7]: Metta is one of my favorite targets, but also the most fickle for me. I have a trauma and dissociative background, I had to learn this stuff to sort dissociation from meditation.

Categories of feelings they might feel instead (an incomplete list!):
* Anger
	* Self-hatred.
* Disgust
	* Contempt
* Fear
	* Helpless, insecure, anxious, vulnerable.
* Surprise
	* Shock, overwhelm, confusion
* Sadness
	* Depressed, hopeless, miserable, despair, heartbroken
* Shame
	* Self-conscious, chagrin[^8], humiliation. 

[^8]: This is the feeling felt when someone said "I feel like a failure." That's chagrin.

Specific feelings that can lead to suicidal ideation:
* Fear - helpless, vulnerability
* Sadness - hopelessness, despair[^9]

[^9]: I have felt everything on this list first-hand. I have contemplated suicide from failed  Metta sessions. I know others who have also contemplated suicide from failed Metta sessions.
