Practicing, guiding, teaching, and/or suggesting meditation involves risk.

The big risks are: suicide, suicidal ideation, self-harm, flashbacks, dissociation, changes in behavior, ... all kinds of human behavior. It is difficult to predict what a practice can uncover, reveal, or dismantle. 

Meditation can arouse difficult feelings, memories, and awareness. In our culture of self-reliance, the things brought to the surface can deeply hurt us, without the support of others. 

This is one of the reasons a teacher is frequently recommended: to identify when support is needed, and provide it.

# First, Do No Harm
I think meditation is not intended to harm us.

A framework of **First, Do No Harm** will have clear boundaries around when to stop a session.

### Ariadne's Stopping Points
**Emotions associated with self-harm.**
* Hopelessness, helplessness, despair
* Dissociation
* Flashbacks
* Chest pain

Guiding our own practice, I recommend erring on the side of caution. Can a practice be made gentler?

Guiding others practices ... is there enough mindfulness and attentiveness to understand how others are doing? Can you tell if someone is dissociating? Do you know them well enough to sense a change in their behavior?

### In Ourselves
##### Emotions
* Positive? 
* Negative? 
* Helpful?
* Painful?

##### Pain
* Around the head? 
* Chest?

##### Thoughts
* Memories? 
* Flashbacks?
* Tasks? 
* Arguments?

## In Others
##### Posture
* Turned in? 
* Guarded? 
* Withdrawn?
* Excited?
* Animated?

##### Energy
* More? 
* Less?

##### Speech
* Nonverbal?
* Quiet? 
* Reserved?

##### Breathing
* Labored? 
* Missing? 
* Breath-holding?

##### Skin
* Flushed? 
* Pale? 
* Goose-bumps?

# These groups are at risk for harm
I've seen these groups struggle most. **It is by no means definitive.** 

### Self-loathing
Inability to meditate is frequently tied to moral agency, and seen as a personal failing.

__**Difficulty meditating is not a moral failing.**__


### Traumatized
Quiet introspection can lead to flashbacks.

### Dissociative
Difficult emotions, unfamiliar tasks, and pressures can lead to dissociation.

Especially insidious because it can look like meditation. People who dissociate tend to be very quiet (nonverbal). To communicate to someone non-verbal, ask if they would like to write down their thoughts and feelings.

### Low Dopamine - ADHD
Failure to sit still, and/or pay attention.

Religious texts group this under "restlessness." Western medicine knows it as a dopamine shortfall. Meditation is easier with movement, music, interesting sensory objects, medication, and/or caffeine.

# Metta is Especially Dangerous

This is a well-intentioned and bright practice. I'm familiar with it from Buddhism, where it has prerequisites for safety:
* Stable loving community
* Secure attachment
* Easy call up of the feelings of love and compassion.

Those without the above prerequisites are in danger.

## A Typical Metta failure:

1. Someone is told to direct their attention towards feelings of love and kindness.
1. They cannot.
1. As they continuously fail to arouse these feelings, **much darker feelings are aroused.**


### Categories of feelings they might feel instead (an incomplete list!):

##### Anger
* Self-hatred

##### Disgust
* Contempt

##### Fear
* Helpless
* Insecure
* Anxious 
* Vulnerable

##### Surprise
* Shock
* Overwhelm
* Confusion

##### Sadness
* Depressed
* Hopeless
* Miserable
* Fatigued
* Despair
* Heartbreak

##### Shame
* Self-conscious
* Embarassment
* Humiliation
* Awkward
* Chagrin

### Specific feelings that can lead to suicidal ideation
When two specific feelings combine, they lead directly to suicidal ideation

##### Fear
* Hopeless

##### Sadness
* Despair

> I have felt everything on this list first-hand. I have contemplated suicide from failed Metta sessions. I know others who have also contemplated suicide from failed Metta sessions.
