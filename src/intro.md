The DBT materials are found on my other site, [dbtwithariadne.com](https://www.dbtwithariadne.com)

This a spiritual/religious/meditation blog.

Some of the stuff I've included is my ideas or opinions. Other stuff comes from various authors, or the [Pali Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon)

I know this stuff is sometimes contentious, I hope the reader has an easy time with it, and it doesn't cause you harm.
