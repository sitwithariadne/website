I'm gonna write about some wrong views (read as harmful) that come up in spiritual circles.

These views are considered wrong from the *perspective* of Buddhism and Enlightenment which are both concerned with reducing harm and minimizing suffering.[^suffering-sucks]

[^suffering-sucks]: A lot of philosophy is built around the idea that we can't know anything for sure. Buddhism takes as axiomatic that *suffering exists and it sucks.* 
	
	Usually if I'm debating someone about the existence of suffering, and notice "Oh, wait, I'm suffering over getting this person to believe this", I step away from the conversation to do something I enjoy like eat, play a video game, or going for a walk. 
	If you find yourself, surrounded, by people you are constantly trying to convince that ... life can have meaning or purpose, that suffering can be overcome and avoided ... and they don't get it, move on. 
	
	It's OK to enjoy things, really. People will always be wrong on the internet. Let them.

If someone holds wrong view ... it's not the best use of time to debate them, because the debate, itself, can cause suffering.[^suffering] This gets contentious in mixed spiritual communities when others are debating how we arrive at meaning and purpose in our lives.[^victor]

[^suffering]: Here is [how to tell](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2021/06/should-i-end-this-relationship.html) if a relationship causes suffering.

[^victor]: [Victor Frankl](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/0807014273/) survived the Holocaust and wrote a book about it (he attributes this to a mixture of views and luck.) One of the things he allowed himself was the ability to assign meaning and purpose to life. Neither of these things seem *inherent,*  but there are lived consequences for not assigning meaning or purpose.

I would be mindful about pulling away someone's blanket.[^brutal-truth]

[^brutal-truth]: [I made a flowchart](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2020/11/should-i-say-this.html) to help figure out if you should say something. Brutal truth is usually more brutal than true. Brutal truth doesn't follow the [8-fold path](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2020/12/eightfold-path-wall-chart.html) and doesn't follow harmlessness.

Keep in mind, the goal here isn't to just believe stuff, but to have process to discover if it's helpful, harmful, true, false, or describes reality.

I'm basing this article on this fundamental understanding...

## Foundation -- The Truth -- Felt experience contains ...
1. **Contentedness/Peace/Happiness/Joy** -- things we generally want. 
2. **Pain/Suffering/Turmoil** -- things we don't generally want.

The first goal of someone practicing wrong view is to get you to abandon your own felt reality. If they can get you to abandon your felt reality and substitute in their ideas, they've won.

It's up to you what kind of life you want to live and if you want to seek out things like ... peace, contentment, health, safety, connectedness, joy, happiness, purpose, and meaning. Those things exist and people have them. Another way to say this is, *views have consequences and be aware of what you and others want.*

Keep in mind, someone *without these things* who has *given up on finding them* will project why *you should give up too.* That's how they cope without them.

Keep in mind, someone *who thinks they have these things* will try and convince you *they have it too.* It's up to you to rely on your own understanding and felt experience to understand ... if they do!

I need to define a bunch of wrong views...

## Wrong views rooted in ignoring cause and effect.[^six-teachers]

[^six-teachers]: The [Six Heretical Teachers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Heretical_Teachers) These views have been popular for *millenia.* They aren't going away, at a certain point, you need to remove yourself from the conversation and live your life.

**[Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Buddhism)) (Ig)**  
See also [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). 

Basically, it's ignorance of ignorance. In Buddhism ignorance is defined as "not understanding internal process," and meditation is a pathway towards understandings and changing our internal reality. It is not the only pathway.

We meditate to figure out what's going on in there and to see what all we can change.

**Non-Causality (NC)**
If you have a friend where bad stuff is always happening to them, something you might hear is, "stuff just happens to me" ... but on investigating you notice they don't make ... great choices. Non-causality is trying to separate cause and effect. 

**[Amorality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorality) (Am)** 
An indifference to morality. Morality as optional. Sometimes 



A lot of these are rooted in [Personality Disorders](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/personality-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20354463) and online, anything goes. The people on the street you'd walk past if they were ranting, are online now and *very active.*

**[Fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism) (F)** 
Future consequences are inevitable, humans are powerless to change anything.

Since the Sun is going to burn out in a few billion years, it doesn't matter what we do to the Earth.

This used to be more popular with certain religious beliefs, and it falls in and out of favor with the times. See also [Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism).

**[Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism) (N)** 
Nothing matters, because nothing can be known in the absolute. Morality can't be a thing, so we can't know good and evil.[^very-useless] Sort of sidesteps the problem of, "it hurts when people hit me, I'd prefer if they didn't" and, "I'm sad my pet just died."

[^very-useless]: [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nihilism) has a great definition of Nihilism. If someone is into this, it's a good use of time to find something else to do besides debate them. I wrote this article mostly to just throw them the URL and move on with my life.

**[Agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism)  (Ag)**
Knowledge can't be known, don't bother.
Truth can't be known, don't bother.

## Wrong views rooted in sense-desire

... Usually rooted in a desire for the world to be a certain way, or for a person to do a specific thing.

**Aversion and Hatred (A&H)**
Normalizing hatred is a very human experience, but it isn't a spiritual goal. Even hating hatred isn't a spiritual goal. Hatred exists and we seek to reduce it, but we shouldn't hate it. Aversion usually takes the form of "you shouldn't do or believe X", where X is whatever the person doesn't like. Usually takes the form of "that belief system sucks, you should try mine."

**Desperation and Seeking (D&S)**  
We do desperate things and seek very hard when we've been denied something important. One of the classic desperation tools is gaslighting -- overwriting reality with an idea of reality.

Classical gaslighting takes the form of "What you really experienced was ..." where the gaslighter then tells the other person what "happened".

A very common spiritual gaslight is ...  "I'm not suffering" or "I'm not feeling those emotions." I saw a very famous "woke person" tell someone else they weren't suffering. That's extremely desperate.

Seeking is about trying to find "the thing" to complete us. Finding the thing is very much The Quest but so is trying to convince yourself you've found it. Sometimes this puts people into desperate situations where they are trying to convince others they are really fine.

... now with those out of the way, I can tell you *why* each of these statements is wrong view.

# Some wrong views

##  wrong views about how to live

- don't seek after pleasant experiences (NC, A&H)
- meaning and purpose don't exist (Am, Ag)
-  your job doesn't matter (Ig, Am, NC, S&D, N)

##  wrong views about reality

- stuff just happens (NC, F)
- everything is pre-determined (F)


##  wrong views about how to reduce suffering (or feel better)

- detach from everything -- friends, family, hobbies (Ag, N, Am)
- meditate everyday without fail (F, D&S, A&H)
- find a teacher immediately (F, A&H)
- you must follow X practice (F, A&H)

##  wrong views about identity and psychology

- the ego is the enemy -- destroy it (A&H)
- get rid of negative emotions -- anger, sadness, jealousy (A&H)
- be completely self-reliant (A&H, D&S)
- you already have everything you need (D&S)
- you are already woke[^already-woke]
- therapy is a waste of time
- you can cure yourself with zero help

 [^already-woke]: Personality Disorders are a thing and some of them are even curable. I also wouldn't tell someone with depression, anxiety, or a broken limb, "everything is actually fine, you are just looking at this whole thing all wrong."

##  wrong views about the Earth (the species)

- we all die anyway (Am, F, A&H)
- in the absolute, none of this matters (N, Ag)
- everything, everywhere, is fine (Am)

##  wrong views about the present

- you have everything you need right here (NC, D&S)
- the moment is perfect[^Despair] (NC, F, D&S)

[^Despair]: Despair is a felt emotion, along with hopelessness, helplessness, heartbreak and devastation. There are practices to reduce and minimize these, but if they are present ... those moments are **extremely hard** to handle. 

	Practice is building process to mostly minimize these darker states. `Every Moment Is Perfect` sort of ignores the reality of the brain, which is -- a brain that has felt a lot of despair is good at feeling despair and a brain that hasn't practiced a lot of happiness, isn't good at feeling happy. Practice is usually retraining the brain into feeling brighter states more often and darker ones less often. Therapy is rooted here, retraining the mind to rewire the brain.

	I view it as **spiritual abuse** to tell someone they should be enjoying themselves because the moment is perfect.
	
	Everyone is capable of determining for themselves what they enjoy and don't enjoy.

##  wrong views of others

- everyone has something to teach you (Am, D&S)
- no one can teach anyone, anything (NC, Ag, D&S)
- you shouldn't be hurt by others (Am, N)
- you have no right to request anyone act a specific way (Am, NC, D&S)
- accept everything from anyone, always (D&S)

##  wrong views spiritual practice

- as a marketplace of ideas -- all ideas are essentially equal (D&S)
- all ideas have their place and purpose (D&S)
- there is nothing to do -- you are already there (NC, D&S)
- teachers aren't needed (NC, D&S)  
- no one is in control (NC)
- non-duality is better (A&H, D&S)  
- never use duality (A&H, D&S)
- everyone's practice is valid (D&S)

# FAQ

## WWWD? What would a woke person do?

They'd avoid making more suffering, theirs or other people's. The technique doesn't seem to matter as much as the results. There seem to be a lot of paths to places that ... make less suffering.


## How do I know if I'm woke or if others are woke?

-   You are aware of the amount of suffering you generate for yourself or others.
-   You can acknowledge when you create suffering for yourself and others.
-   You work to prevent, diminish, or stop the suffering of others.

## What are some practices rooted in wrong view?

A dark term is spiritual abuse. For a longer treatment of this see [Psychopaths and Saints.](https://eudoxos.github.io/saints/html/index.html)

For a shorter treatment see my article on [narcissism](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2021/06/the-narcissists-prayer.html).

The most common tools rooted in wrong view are below:

- **Blank Slate** - Doesn't have interests, hobbies, or emotions.
