_i am allowed to want to feel and be safe.  
i am allowed to be angry, express anger.  
i am allowed to feel desire.  
i am allowed to use coping mechanisms when i don't have brighter tools available.  
it's hard to feel anger and hurt right now.  
feeling angry is part of the human experience. everybody feels anger sometimes.  
what can i do for myself in this moment?  
peacefulness. love. ease. happiness. bliss.  
i want to take care of you.  
i don't want you to suffer.  
i care about you._
