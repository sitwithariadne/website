The Buddha was big on discernment. When someone asked him what makes someone an Outcast/Lowlife he gave a pretty detailed answer. I've condensed it from the Sutta:

[Sn 1.7 - The Lowlife](https://suttacentral.net/snp1.7/en/sujato?) 

* Harms living creatures and has no kindness for creatures
* Irritable, hostile, wicked, offensive, deceitful, deficient in view
* Destroys Villages, Cities
* Thieves & Muggers
* Lying to someone about owing a debt
* Lying to others to create wealth
* Making up stories about stuff that didn't happen.
* Trying to sleep with others committed sexual partners
* Not taking care of parents in old age
* Abusing family verbally or physically
* Asked what is good, teaches what is actually bad.
* Gives advice with a hidden agenda.
* Hides bad deeds from others.
* Eats at another's place, doesn't return the favor.
* Lies to religious people (monks, nuns, nobles).
* Abuses or doesn't share food with religious people (monks, nuns, nobles).
* Extols themselves and disparages others.
* Bullies
* Wealth hoarders
* Oppressors
* Insults the Buddha or the Buddha's disciples.
* Claims to be perfected -- but isn't (this is considered the lowest)

Someone isn't permanently an Outcast/Lowlife, but while doing these things, they can fall into this category.
