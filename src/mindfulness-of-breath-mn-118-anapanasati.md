Mindfulness of Breath is the path the Buddha took to reach his Enlightenment. It isn't the only path, but it's a popular one, because the breath is always with us. 

Breath is triggering for some folx. If it doesn't work for you, that's OK. There are effective ways to meditate.
  
He presents his path in 16 steps, each step building on the previous one. They are:


#### Body group (Self-regulation and Scope)

1. Breathing in long, they discern, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, they discern, 'I am breathing out long.'
