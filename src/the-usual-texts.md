People ask me what I would recommend reading. I don't recommend reading, I recommend *practice.*

I put some stuff below as part of the "Usual Texts" stuff that gets recommended by others frequently that I read, that I considered helpful.

### Ariadne's Usual Texts

My texts come from the [Pāḷi Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon) in the [Thai Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Forest_Tradition) tradition. My primary inspiration is [Ajahn Brahm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Brahm)
