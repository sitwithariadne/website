There are a lot of ways to organize and think about feelings, which are internal emotions without words or thoughts. I use a feelings wheel based on NVC (Non-violent Communication).

Two groups of six: needs being met, needs not being met.

**Needs Met**

* Pride (Self-Confidence, Self-Esteem, Encouraged, Powerful)  
* Joy (Happy, Ecstatic, Excited, Grateful)  
* Intrigue (Engaged, Fascinated, Entranced, Energetic)  
* Trust (Assured, Hopeful, Secure, Confident)  
* Love (Affectionate, Adoration, Connected, Caring)  
* Peace (Content, Relaxed, Tranquil, Harmonious)

**Needs Not Met**

* Anger (Frustrated, Annoyed, Envious, Mad)  
* Disgust (Averse, Apathetic, Repulsive, Contempt)  
* Fear (Insecure, Anxious, Vulnerable, Scared)  
* Surprise (Astonished, Distracted, Startled, Overwhelmed)  
* Sadness (Depressed, Pain & Hurt, Grief & Sorrow, Unhappy)  
* Shame (Awkward, Guilty, Embarrassed, Humiliation)

## Prompting Events for Emotions

Use this list to reason backwards to what emotion was probably felt.

### Needs Met 

**Proud (self-acceptance)**
`Effectual` An activity you value was performed well.
`Encouraged` Someone you trust/value gave you a positive appraisal.

**Joyful (gain)**
* You've gained something.
* A need has been met.

**Intrigued (attentive)**
* Paying close attention leads towards positive emotions.

**Trusting (security)**
* Associating with someone/something could lead toward getting a need met.

**Loving (attractive)**
* Loving a person, animal, or object enhances quality of life for you or for those you care about.
* Loving a person, animal, or object increases your chances of attaining your own personal goals.

	`Affectionate` The urge to take care of someone/something to get more love.

	`Reverance` The urge to worship someone/something as they are viewed as godly/divine/perfect.

**Peaceful (acceptance)**
* Events occurring should keep occurring as they are.
* Other:

### Needs Not Met

**Anger (judgement)** 
`Anger` 1. An important goal is blocked or a desired activity is interrupted or prevented.
`Anger` 2. You/Your-group/Someone-you-care-about is offended/insulted/attacked/hurt/threatened.
`Envy` 1. Someone-else/group gets/has things you want/need/crave.
`Jealousy` 1. A very important and desired relationship or object in your life is in danger of being damaged or lost.
`Jealousy` 2. Someone is threatening to take a valued relationship or object away from you.

**Disgust (repulsion)**

**Afraid (threatened)**

**Sadness (loss)**

* Things are not the way you wanted or expected and hoped them to be.

**Ashamed (self-judgement)**
`Shame` Urge towards silence. You risk being abandoned by a group if characteristics of yourself or of your behavior are made public.
`Guilt` Your own behavior violates your own values or moral code.
