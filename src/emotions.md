[Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion#Definitions) are felt experiences, contrasted with [dissocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology)), and [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emptiness).

The ability to feel emotions is double-edged, there are pleasant and unpleasant emotions.

There are lots of ways to conceptalize emotions, the system I use is Non-Violent Communications which puts emotions into two main groups.
