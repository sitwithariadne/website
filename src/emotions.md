There are a lot of ways to organize and think about feelings, which are internal emotions without words or thoughts. 

I use a feelings wheel based on NVC (Non-violent Communication).

## Prompting Events for Emotions

Use this list to reason backwards to what emotion was probably felt.

### Needs Met 

**Proud (self-acceptance)**

- `Effectual` An activity you value was performed well.
- `Encouraged` Someone you trust/value gave you a positive appraisal.

**Joyful (gain)**

- You've gained something.
- A need has been met.

**Intrigued (attentive)**

- Paying close attention leads towards positive emotions.

**Trusting (security)**

- Associating with someone/something could lead toward getting a need met.

**Loving (attractive)**

- Loving a person, animal, or object enhances quality of life for you or for those you care about.
- Loving a person, animal, or object increases your chances of attaining your own personal goals.
  - `Affectionate` The urge to take care of someone/something to get more love.
  - `Reverance` The urge to worship someone/something as they are viewed as godly/divine/perfect.
