[MN19 - Two Kinds of Thought](<https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/sujato>)

Learning how to put thoughts into buckets: good or bad.

This is the Buddha talking to mendicants (followers subsisting on food and essentials obtained via begging)

This is [Sujato's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhante_Sujato) translation. I have edited for brevity.

> Mendicants, before my awakening — when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening — I thought:
> 
> "Why don’t I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes?"
> 
> * I assigned sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts to one class. 
> * I assigned thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness to the second class.
