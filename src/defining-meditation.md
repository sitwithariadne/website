# Do No Harm, and permission to stop

If something hurts, you have permission and are encouraged to stop.

*Let the person reading these instructions, understand at any point, in any context, if you consider yourself *tortured* during a meditation (with a group, in a building, on a retreat, at home), you can and should end it and do something else.

# Meditation is difficult, how much *should* it hurt?

**Developed** meditaiton is the most enjoyable human experience.

**Undeveloped** the amount of pain I would set as a boundary is hygine discomfort, i.e. as painful as brushing teeth, or taking a bath.

If it hurts more than that, you have permission and are encouraged to stop.

# How much time?

I would pick an amount you view as trivial, these are all valid picks:

* 5 seconds
* 10 seconds
* 30 seconds
* 1 minute
* etc.
  
# Does my body need to be a certain posture?

The same posture you might use to watch a movie or play a video game.

# Whats the goal?

Relief.

# What is the core skill?

Renunciation, another way to say this is letting go.

# What does letting go mean?

* Maybe I'm worried about work. For the period of meditaiton I'll use self-compassion to consciously redirect my mind away from work, towards another more wholesome object.

# Is there a correct way to let go?

Yes, using self-compassion.

# I tried to stay with the object, but I got distracted.

Use self-compassion to reassure yourself this is normal.

    - "Oh, I was thinking about work, I must be worried about it, but I want to give myself this break"
    - "I want to do something else, but this is time I'm spending practicing kindness and that's OK."  



 **"But don't I have to do these things (remain absolutely still -- never think) to meditate?"**

Kindness towards our sensory universe is what we are practicing, it's a cultivated skill, I don't think we can get it all at once. Part of that is forgiveness, it's OK to make mistakes, to learn, to grow.

## But what if  I'm not kind to myself?  

**That's OK too. We are practicing.**

We are practicing  _intending_  towards kindness. I feel it's important to practice being nice to ourselves, and for these few moments, we want to  **lower our expectations**, not raise them. A lot of folx expect a lot out of us, constantly, especially ourselves. Meditation is a place where we can really practice being gentle with ourselves.

-   I gently invite myself to relax.
-   I remind myself it doesn't seem to help to expect anything.

What next?

I invite some awareness into my body. I view meditation as a pathway to cultivate self-compassion & self-awareness.

-   If I'm calm, or happy, or relaxed. I just ... melt into those things. I don't seek anything else out. I stop and enjoy what is there.

If I'm not in a good starting place (my internal world is chaotic, or noisy, or loud) I find a part of myself I can watch and relax into. These places are called anchors. Think of it like finding a window during a rainstorm to look outside. You are safe inside, looking out onto the rain.

-   Sometimes it's the breath. I like to take nice slow breaths (it slows down thoughts).
-   Sometimes it's the mind thinking things. I don't stop the thoughts, I intend to just watch them, like rain.
-   Sometimes it's body posture. I gently notice how I'm holding the body.
-   Sometimes it's emotions. I don't try to control them, just watch them unfold.
-   Sometimes it's tingles or body sensations. I don't try and control or even understand. Just watch.

If pleasant sensations (like calm, or happiness or relaxation) appear doing the above, I savor them, then I try and remember what I did to reach this pleasant state. The danger is thinking repeating the exact same steps works, every time. That's what makes this practice, learning what works and what doesn't with kindness.

A tremendous kindness we can give ourselves is ... just knowing what's going on inside ourselves. Judgement doesn't seem to help, when I judge myself I say "that's OK" and watch the judgement. Kindness heals judgement, not more judgement.

I wouldn't push for force myself, kindness doesn't arrive via force, we are **not** trying to overpower the mind.

I remind myself that if what I'm doing is making my meditation worse, I shouldn't do it. I pick other things to do.

 ## Mantras 
When I find it's too hard to observe, or I notice my thoughts are speeding up, I try and ground myself in a mantra, which is just an intention I repeat over and over again. One of my teachers said it's like casting seeds, sometimes we may need to cast a lot of seeds, and that's OK.  
  
**I never repeat a mantra I don't agree with.** I don't want to lie to myself. Pick one (or a few):

-   _May I enjoy spending time with myself._
-   _May I enjoy practicing kindness with myself._
-   _May I practice self-compassion._
-   _May I let go of expectations._
-   _May I judge myself less._
-   _May I let go of perfectionism._
-   _May I enjoy being vs doing._
-   _May I forgive myself for not understanding._
-   _May I forgive myself for not being able to forgive myself._
-   *May I hate myself less.*
-   *May I learn to trust my own sensations.*

## Ending Early 

Sometimes I end my meditations early, they are too hard. That's OK too. I usually end a meditation early if I can tell it's making me worse, _faster._ Sometimes afterwards I want to immediately meditate more, so ... I'll just repeat these instructions.
