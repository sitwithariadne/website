One of the upper fetters is conceit. I've been looking for a formal definition of conceit so I could start practicing with it.

I was watching a talk from Ajahn Brahm about [MN20 - The Removal of Distracting Thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o5Ok73-NXw&t=1s) and ... there is a place he defined conceit.

**Conceit**

- I am better
- I am worse
- I am the same

I've started working with conceit directly using a mantra to the opposite:
"Not better, not worse, not the same."


## Not Better

Sometimes I get a strong effectual feeling.

Maybe I have a meditation go well, or I give really solid help to someone. Maybe I'm comparing my situation to someone else. From this position I am in a desirous place.

Conceit arises. I am better!

I've been practicing telling myself, 
"Where I am and how my life goes is tied to my circumstances and intentions." 
"Where this other person is and how their life goes is tied to their circumstances and their intentions."

I allow myself gratitude -- for my circumstances, and for my intentions. I send others in a less desirous place metta, vs contempt or scorn for "not knowing better." I avoid blaming others for their circumstances or intentions.

## Not Worse

Some circumstances are clearly desirous (friends, family, health, genetics) and many do not have desirous circumstances.

Conceit arises. I am worse!

I allow myself sadness and grief -- for my circumstances. I send myself metta vs contempt or scorn for "not knowing better." I avoid blaming myself for my circumstances or intentions.

## Not the Same

Parts of my experience are similar to others. Maybe I hear someone relate a part of their life then feel "Oh, I have the answer to this, because I've experienced something similar."

I've been practicing telling myself, "I am similar but not the same. I don't know this person's circumstances unless they tell me. I must be careful of my projections onto them."
