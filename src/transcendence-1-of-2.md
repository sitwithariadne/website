I've been doing zazen for about 2 and a half months. A few days ago, I had either the arising and passing or the full on stream-entry. The kind of thing people go to Burma for.

I remember after I was finished, I hugged Jackie super hard and said it was over. That I had tasted ultimate truth, and it tastes exactly like you think it would.

Zazen is all about transcendence, but they don’t use that term. The goal is to keep your mind on the breath, and the sensation of breathing. Feel the diaphragm move, the lungs fill, the hairs in your nose move with airflow. These sensations are **real**, the most real life can get. No worrying about the past, no worrying about the future, no contemplation of self. Just the sensation of the breath and the body breathing.

Little by little I learned to transcend by doing, … everything. Nothing is sacred except the act of breathing, and the end of Zen is to … transcend the awareness of the breath itself.

The other day, I was really into it. The feeling following the breath is like trying to lock onto a signal the universe sends out. Trying to follow the breath, to be aware of the breath is hard, because being aware of the breath modifies it. This is subject-object duality. “I am breathing.”

The goal isn’t to follow the breath, but to become breath ... for the sensation of breath to become everything.

Anyway, I was doing this for a bit, getting very into the breath, and there is this peculiar sensation like following a sine wave ... [Part 2](https://www.sitwithariadne.com/2020/06/transcendence-2-of-2.html)
