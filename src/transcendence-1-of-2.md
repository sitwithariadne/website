I've been doing zazen for about 2 and a half months. A few days ago, I had either the arising and passing or the full on stream-entry. The kind of thing people go to Burma for.

I remember after I was finished, I hugged Jackie super hard and said it was over. That I had tasted ultimate truth, and it tastes exactly like you think it would.

Zazen is all about transcendence, but they don’t use that term. The goal is to keep your mind on the breath, and the sensation of breathing. Feel the diaphragm move, the lungs fill, the hairs in your nose move with airflow. These sensations are **real**, the most real life can get. No worrying about the past, no worrying about the future, no contemplation of self. Just the sensation of the breath and the body breathing.

Little by little I learned to transcend by doing, … everything. Nothing is sacred except the act of breathing, and the end of Zen is to … transcend the awareness of the breath itself.

The other day, I was really into it. The feeling following the breath is like trying to lock onto a signal the universe sends out. Trying to follow the breath, to be aware of the breath is hard, because being aware of the breath modifies it. This is subject-object duality. “I am breathing.”

The goal isn’t to follow the breath, but to become breath ... for the sensation of breath to become everything.

Anyway, I was doing this for a bit, getting very into the breath, and there is this peculiar sensation like following a sine wave ... 

… and being slightly out of phase with it. I locked onto the phase and frequency of breathing, so it was no longer a discontinuous entity.  
  
Then something strange happened, I was no longer aware of anything, breathing or otherwise. For a split second, the smallest instant, there was perfect quiet. It must have been on a down breath.  
  
I knew as soon as the experience was over, I was forever changed. I had seen it, the thing people spend their entire lives questing for, this quiet. To think the quietness has a name is beyond funny, or that it has silly terms like nirvana.  
  
After transcending the first time, every time becomes a question of degree. It had such a final quality to it and left me with this weird feeling at the top of my spine where my skull starts. A kind of pressing.  
  
What did I learn?  
  
I learned that we are the collection of held viewpoints, most of which are accidental. We have thoughts that can never be us, just consequences of our environment. That all suffering is completely fair, because we are equal in death. That life is the most precious gift anyone or anything can ever be given, because it allows sensation. Any sensation, even pain, is a tremendous blessing. In the same vein, it is a heinous crime to cause another thing suffering, since… it it always done by choice.  
  
The universe is jealous of our consciousness. All enjoy simple acts like eating, breathing, and sleeping. We are all part of the same thing, a mass of people trying to all get along with a billion different ways to view the world, all endowed with the power to change everything, or nothing.  
  
I can’t really describe it, other then knowing I’ll never consider suicide again. I also don’t see how it will be possible to experience deep depression again. I told Jackie after the experience we could be homeless and it would be OK, because we have each other and I finally fully understood the significance of finding someone else to be with moment-to-moment and why I had looked so hard to find Jackie.  
  
I went to the Zendo a few days later to have the Zen master check my work, and she was unimpressed (lol, who cares) and reminded me that my practice, looking for attainments, speed, etc, wasn’t, “Soto Zen” (lol, who cares). I knew it was impossible to check the work before I went, but I wanted to at least make the attempt. I told her I would make the effort to have repeatable experiences … but honestly I don’t even think it’s worth the effort. How many times do you need to see God to know He exists?  
  
I want to continue to meditate. It’s given me so much and I want to pass Zen onto my child.  
  
Daniel Ingram, to his credit, made a very good map, but it isn’t a Zen map. I wanted to think that everyone would follow the same route (lol) and have the same experiences (lol) but now, (and only now) do I realize ... All solutions are necessarily personal. There are many ways to taste the truth.  
  
I’m grateful I didn’t do Mahasi Sayadaw style noting. I don’t want to break reality into individual sensations (although I’m immensely aware that all reality can be is sensations) and I’m OK with not perceiving individual vibrations (this seems like such a useful skill, lol, not really). Instead what I did was whenever I had a thought, I would go “this isn’t me, this is impermanent, and it won’t satisfy” and immediately went back to noting the sensations of the breath.
