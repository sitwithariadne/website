**cw: pain, abuse, trauma, dissociation, suicide, self-harm**

*I hope nothing I've written in this book causes myself or others to come to harm.*

# Why this blog exists

I have two forces in my life, that give me tremendous incentive to learn the mechanics to suffer less: chronic pain and dissociation.

I dissociate, so I've gotten good at writing stuff down.

I want to help others, so what I can share publicly about how to suffer less, I've written here.

# Privacy

These are my references, or bonafides. My experience being alive has so far been harrowing. I am fearful of providing more detail in a public setting.

# Chronic pain

I developed daily chronic pain in October of 2015.

I get migraines now, and meditation helps with those too.

My meditation practice helps me with both kinds of pain.

# Dissociation 

Early childhood abuse means I [dissociate](https://www.isst-d.org/resources/dissociation-faqs/).

My meditation practice helps manage dissociation.
