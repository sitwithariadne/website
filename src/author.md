**cw: pain, abuse, trauma, dissociation, suicide, self-harm**

*I hope nothing I've written in this book causes myself or others to come to harm.*

# Why this blog exists

I have two forces in my life, that give me tremendous incentive to learn the mechanics to suffer less: chronic pain and dissociation.

# Dissociation 

I sometimes [dissociate](https://www.isst-d.org/resources/dissociation-faqs/). While dissociation can be a useful coping strategy, it is disruptive, so I started to look for alternative ways to cope.

Forgetting things isn't glamorous. There is always the risk that if I don't write something down, I will forget it. This blog represents some of the brightest parts of myself I want to remember and share with others.

Without written record, my lived experience sometimes becomes moment-to-moment and some moments are unbearable. I'm in several overlapping groups for suicide risk. I want to survive those future moments of psychic pain. 

# Chronic pain

I have two kinds of chronic pain. These are unpleasant sensations I feel frequently, sometimes daily, sometimes severely, sometimes disabling.

One is pelvic floor related; I find physical therapy and acupuncture help.
The other is migraine related; I find meditation helps me a great deal with my migraines.

# Peer-Support

Some of the materials found on this blog, I have laminated in my house. They are my personal materials.

I find I do better when I'm helping others use the same methods I myself am using. It gives me incentive to read new texts and learn new methods.
