## In Verse form

```
A friend gives what is hard to give, 
and does what’s hard to do. 

They put up with your harsh words, 
and with things hard to endure.

They tell you their secrets, 
and keep your secrets for you. 

They don’t abandon you in times of trouble, 
or look down on you in times of loss.

The person in whom 
these things are found is your friend. 

If you want to have a friend, 
you should keep company with such a person.” 
```
