# A Friend
```
    (1) They give what is beautiful,
        hard to give,

    (2) does what is hard to do,

    (3) endures painful, ill-spoken words.

    (4) Their secrets they tell you,
        your secrets they keep.

    (6) When misfortunes strike,
        They don't abandon you;

    (7) When you're down & out,
        doesn't look down on you.

A person in whom these traits are found,
is a friend to be cultivated
by anyone wanting a friend.
