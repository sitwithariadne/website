I recommend practicing mindfulness and compassion, together.

### My tradition 
[Pāḷi Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon) - [Thai Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Forest_Tradition) - [Ajahn Brahm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Brahm) 
My meditaiton practice is [jhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhyana_in_Buddhism) oriented, deep states of non-dual stillness.
  
I've had a lot of mystical experiences at this point, that was one of the primary things I wanted at one point, but now that I've had them, this is the religion I'm following for this lifetime.
  
Why Jhana? Jhana is [nibbana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism)) now. Nibbana means quenching, like a fire being doused with water.


I'm not recomminding any of the below texts, these are considered the classical route, stuff I have (or at one time had) in my personal library.
