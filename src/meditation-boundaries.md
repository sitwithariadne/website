To Relax.

### Do No Harm

Meditation can be uncomfortable, the amount of discomfort I would set as a boundary is hygine discomfort, i.e. as painful as brushing teeth, making a meal, or taking a bath.

If it hurts more than that, I would encourage you to stop.

### How much time

I would pick an amount you view as trivial, these are all valid picks:

- 5 seconds
- 10 seconds
- 30 seconds
- 1 minute
- etc.
  
### Posture

The same posture you might use to watch a movie or play a video game.

### Goals

Relief.

### Core Skills

- Renunciation, another way to say this is letting go.
- Kindfulness, the merging of mindfulness with kindness.

### What does letting go mean?

- Setting down the past, worrying about that later
- Setting down the future, worrying about that later
- Setting down painful emotions 

### Is there a correct way to let go?

Yes, with kindness.

### Don't I have to ...

No.

# How to Practice

Two general things ahappening in the mind:
- Thoughts
- Awareness

Meditation is learning how to place emphasis on specific mental objects.

### 10 Seconds via Body Awareness

- Rub your hands togethers
- Wiggle your toes
- Pet a soft object (Plushie, Cat, Dog, etc.)

Notice the sensation going on -- that's it.

-

If I'm not in a good starting place (my internal world is chaotic, or noisy, or loud) I find a part of myself I can watch and relax into. These places are called anchors. Think of it like finding a window during a rainstorm to look outside. You are safe inside, looking out onto the rain.

-   Sometimes it's the breath. I like to take nice slow breaths (it slows down thoughts).
-   Sometimes it's the mind thinking things. I don't stop the thoughts, I intend to just watch them, like rain.
-   Sometimes it's body posture. I gently notice how I'm holding the body.
-   Sometimes it's emotions. I don't try to control them, just watch them unfold.
-   Sometimes it's tingles or body sensations. I don't try and control or even understand. Just watch.

If pleasant sensations (like calm, or happiness or relaxation) appear doing the above, I savor them, then I try and remember what I did to reach this pleasant state. The danger is thinking repeating the exact same steps works, every time. That's what makes this practice, learning what works and what doesn't with kindness.

A tremendous kindness we can give ourselves is ... just knowing what's going on inside ourselves. Judgement doesn't seem to help, when I judge myself I say "that's OK" and watch the judgement. Kindness heals judgement, not more judgement.

I wouldn't push for force myself, kindness doesn't arrive via force, we are **not** trying to overpower the mind.

I remind myself that if what I'm doing is making my meditation worse, I shouldn't do it. I pick other things to do.

 ## Mantras 
When I find it's too hard to observe, or I notice my thoughts are speeding up, I try and ground myself in a mantra, which is just an intention I repeat over and over again. One of my teachers said it's like casting seeds, sometimes we may need to cast a lot of seeds, and that's OK.  
  
**I never repeat a mantra I don't agree with.** I don't want to lie to myself. Pick one (or a few):

- "May I enjoy spending time with myself."
- "May I enjoy practicing kindness with myself."
- "May I practice self-compassion."
- "May I let go of expectations."
- "May I judge myself less."
- "May I let go of perfectionism."
- "May I enjoy being vs doing."
- "May I forgive myself for not understanding."
- "May I forgive myself for not being able to forgive myself."
- "May I hate myself less."
- "May I learn to trust my own sensations."

# Ending Early

Also OK.

I sometimes end early, especially self-guided meditations. I'll try to do some other gentle mindfulness activity like going for a walk.
